I am trying to commit to working in the public, so I'm trialing  confidentiality labels within the properties of the file in order to better support this effort. This is still a work in progress. 
I am going to start with  [[001- PARA/01- Projects/Garden/confidentiality levels\|confidentiality levels]] that are found in the [[003-Notes/GitLab  Handbook\|GitLab  Handbook]] as a jumping off point.

- 🌍 Public: This emoji signifies that the content is open to the world.
- 🔒 Not Public: This emoji signifies that some information within the doc is not public. 
- 🏠 Internal: This emoji signifies that the content is internal, accessible to a select group but not to everyone.
- 🗝️ Limited Access: This emoji signifies that access to the content is highly restricted, even within the internal realm.

For your example document, the structure would look like this:

- Title: Flowers 🔒
    - Paragraph One 🌍
        - Flowers are pretty things that grow from the ground.
    - Paragraph Two 🏠
        - Flowers are my favorite item I see outside.
    - Paragraph Three 🗝️
        - I plan on planting a bunch of flowers in the fall.

This way, it’s clear that the document titled "Flowers" is public, the first paragraph is fully public, the second paragraph is internal, and the third paragraph has limited access. Within this example, the public reader will be able to access the file and read the part part about flowers, but will not be able to see that flowers are my favorite item or that I plan on planting a bunch of flowers in the fall.
