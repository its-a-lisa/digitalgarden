 I like the ability to connect different thoughts and as I am writing and typing, to do a keyboard shortcut and automatically start creating a knowledge base. 
		- When I am typing, certain words or ideas automatically feel like they should be something that should be backlinked
			- Something that I want to connect to other ideas
			- Something I want to highlight and stand out
			- Something that I want to go back to later
