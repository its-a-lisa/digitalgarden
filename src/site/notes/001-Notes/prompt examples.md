```
the below is what I ended up writing, proofread it for spelling and grammar, without changing the wording at all. Describe how the tone and tense comes off; indicate yes or no if it is consistent. If no, point out where it is inconsistent. Indicate if there is any potential plagiarism. Give feedback on what is incorrect in a way that I can improve my writing in the future using specific examples from the text; focus particularly on how I can improve sentence structure; from those suggest give exercises that will improve my writing.
