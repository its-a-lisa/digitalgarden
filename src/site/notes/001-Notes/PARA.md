The PARA Method is grounded in a fundamental observation: **that all the information in your life can be categorized into only four categories.**
	**Projects**: short-term efforts (in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind
	**Areas**: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time 
	**[[Resources\|Resources]]**: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future
	**Archive**: Inactive items from the other 3 categories

**Ask yourself the following three questions** to consider in which project, area, or resource a given piece of information will be most relevant and useful. 

- What project would this be useful? 
- If none: Which area will this be useful for?
- If none: Which resource does this belong to?
- If none, it’s probably best to archive this information or not save it at all.


``` mermaid
graph TD;
    A[What project would this be useful for?]
    B[Which area will this be useful for?]
    C[Which resource does this belong to?]
    D[Archive or don't save this information]

    A -->|None| B;
    B -->|None| C;
    C -->|None| D;
    A -->|Useful| E[Identify Project] 
    B -->|Useful| F[Identify Area] 
    C -->|Useful| G[Identify Resource]
    

```

## #Tips:
- Start with a clean slate
- By constantly saving packets of knowledge in a format that our future self can easily consume, we follow a “pay it forward” strategy that we get to benefit from in the future!
