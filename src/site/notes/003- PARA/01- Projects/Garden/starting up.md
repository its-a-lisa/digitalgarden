Ok, I figured the best way to actually get started with the [[001-Notes/braindump\|braindump]], is to start using the second brain as the second brain :) ... once I had a good feel for things
For me, getting a good feel means that I need to follow my flow which consists of
- [[001-Notes/obsessive research\|obsessive research]] 
	- Opening up a bunch of links
	- Going down rabbit holes
- [[basic level of understanding\|basic level of understanding]]
	- Going into '[[netflix mode\|netflix mode]]' and getting [[001-Notes/Obsidian Plugins\|Obsidian Plugins]]
	- Once I've gotten all the plugins that I could need or want, then I started caring about the [[look and feel\|look and feel]]
	- From the look and feel, I then started to care about [[functionality\|functionality]]
	- Once I got started into caring about functionality, that is when I got into '[[brain activation mode\|brain activation mode]]'
	- With functionality, came [[templates\|templates]]
## Obsessive Research
### Discovery
- ##### Poking around
	- [[personal knowledge notebooks\|personal knowledge notebooks]]
	- browsing other people's [[digital gardens\|digital gardens]]
	- [[analysis of alternative\|analysis of alternative]] 
	- [[demo\|demo]] 
- ##### figuring out what I wanted
	- [[001-Notes/backlinks\|backlinks]]
	- [[001-Notes/node graphs\|node graphs]]
	- [[001-Notes/tool support\|tool support]]
	- [[001-Notes/robust community\|robust community]]
	- [[001-Notes/ability to publish\|ability to publish]]
- ##### and what I didn't want
	- feeling of jankiness
	- feeling of clunkiness
	- having to jerryrig my main things that I wanted
## Basic level of understanding
- poking around
	- first thing I did was to look through all of the [[001-Notes/plugins\|plugins]]
		- I enabled all of the core plugins that came installed by default
		- Originally, I only installed the ones that I thought would be useful
		- Once I had those picked, then I went to look into what other people picked and recommended
		- Then I went full YOLO mode
	- then I took a deep dive tangent into setting up [[001-Notes/obsidian and chatgpt\|obsidian and chatgpt]]
		- this kind of lead me down to a rabbit hole and the video related to [setting things up for DnD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pt6_srUZ7U&t=0s) really put it all together for me
- setting things up
	- then I started going through the plugins and looking at their settings feature
	- From there I dorked around with the layout a little bit
		- I figured out all the little icons can go into different sections and how the different sections work
- tailoring
- using
- customizing
# Observation
- When I started going back and trying to correct formatting and doing arrangement of things, that is when the flow of ideas stopped and got impeded
- The more I started to use an 'outline' way of doing things, the more things stopped working seamlessly and it was 
- In some ways, I like collapsing items, but in other ways, I don't and feel like it is starting to feel too formal by me doing it
- I'm hoping in the future that I can use this in a way that i'm going forward at all times and not trying to go backwards to capture something that I had done before and making sure they get documented
- 
- I think what I like about the idea of this activity is that it'll keep me centered. I have a tendency to open up a lot of different tabs and go down rabbit holes. This will act as both a central hub and a focal points so that I have the freedom to let my mind wander, but then, if I stray too far or if I lose my way, I have a place to come back to. I think by the expectation that I'm going to be taking notes as I go along the way and the notes don't have to be perfect and they can be a stream of thoughts will be helpful so that I'll actually do them.
