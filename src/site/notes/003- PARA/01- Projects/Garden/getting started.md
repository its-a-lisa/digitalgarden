# Observation
- When I started going back and trying to correct formatting and doing arrangement of things, that is when the flow of ideas stopped and got impeded
- The more I started to use an 'outline' way of doing things, the more things stopped working seamlessly and it was 
- In some ways, I like collapsing items, but in other ways, I don't and feel like it is starting to feel too formal by me doing it
- I'm hoping in the future that I can use this in a way that i'm going forward at all times and not trying to go backwards to capture something that I had done before and making sure they get documented
- I think what I like about the idea of this activity is that it'll keep me centered. I hav ea tendency to open up a lot of different tabs and go down rabbit holes. This will act as both a central hub and a focal points so that I have the freedom to let my mind wander, but then, if I stray too far or if I lose my way, I have a place to come back to. I think by the expectation that I'm going to be taking notes as I go along the way and the notes don't have to be perfect and they can be a stream of thoughts will be helpful so that I'll actually do them. 
# Hypothesis
- I wonder if setting up templates will help with flow 
# Annoyances
- [x] Not having templates ✅ 2023-09-26
	-  Fixed: got templates
- [x] Pages not getting automatically organized ✅ 2023-09-26
	- Not sure what this meant at the time, but it doesn't resonate now that I took a break and came back
- [x] I don't like the indentation ✅ 2023-09-26
	- I hate the indentation less now that I stepped away and I'm not trying to perfect it all
- [x] I don't know why some bullets have a purple orb icon next to them ✅ 2023-09-27
	- Something I did made them go away; pretty sure it was related to some indentation or outline feature
	- OK, figured it out; it is when foldable text is folded
- [x] I don't like that the different level of headings aren't different colors ✅ 2023-09-27
	- Now that I applied the [[gummy\|gummy]] [[theme\|theme]] that made the headings different formats from each other; I'm ok that they aren't different colors
	- I don't want to have to put text in a heading, but I want to be able to collapse 
- [x] Not having started from the beginning ✅ 2023-09-27
	- Ok, after reading [Building a Second Brain: The Definitive Introductory Guide](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/#:~:text=START%20WITH%20A%20CLEAN%20SLATE%C2%A0) I feel less annoyed about this based on the part [[starting with a clean slate\|starting with a clean slate]]
- [x] Feeling like I'm starting out wrong and doing the wrong flow of things as it relates to the formatting and headings ✅ 2023-09-27
	- Now that I'm on day two and getting into the flow and I'm updating the headlines and formate for templates of things as I'm going to be better suited and tailored to me, I can see that not having it from the beginning is OK and will evolve over time
- [ ] Not having a quick way to change the letter casing and putting multiple things in CamelCase or Sentence case at once based on the heading level
- [ ] Wanting to get ahead of myself and already have sync and publish set up

# Curiosities
- [ ] how do other people structure their notes; do they use folders or let their notes just roam in the top level
	- [ ] Rather, how do I want to do it; I think after percolating on this a bit, I'm most likely going to do it by creating high docs; this is probably where the 'evergreen' thing comes from. 
# Learnings
- As I was trying to set this up, I realized that [[cloudflare cloud\|cloudflare cloud]] is a heftier setup than I realized
- Most of the gardens are deployed with [[001-Notes/Hugo\|Hugo]] or [[001-Notes/Jekyll\|Jekyll]]
# Ideas
- I'd like a way to have a list of actions and then only undo certain actions
# Lost Sock
- [x] I had a link for ChatGPT and Obsidian that I lost somewhere -- found it! https://dg-docs.ole.dev/ ✅ 2023-09-26

# To Do
- [x] Figure out how to add in dates into ✅ 2023-09-26
- [ ] Figure out how pages for newly created backlinks can get put into a specific folder
- [ ] Figure out a mechanism to categorize notes of specific things as they're getting written
- [ ] For example, I'd like to do a dump of all of the videos I watched to help this journey, but there are two specific videos that stood out to me so I'd like for them to also stand out in the notes
	- From reading [Building a Second Brain: The Definitive Introductory Guide](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/#:~:text=pull%20up%20my%20%E2%80%9C-,Inbox,-%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20a%20separate%20folder) I expect this is going to get done using the 'inbox' method
- [ ] Figure out how to link to different sections within the document
	- I looked this up and the [documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link+to+a+heading+in+a+note) gave a good explanation so if I wanted to link to the [[003- PARA/01- Projects/Garden/getting started#Ideas\|#Ideas]] section I would write `[[#Ideas]]` whereas writing `[[Ideas]]` would take me to  [[ideas\|ideas]] 
- [ ] Set up a styling, modal, etc something that helps create hypothesis that is different and outside of to-do tasks, but kind of works the same way
- [ ] Figure out how to make references
- [ ] Get good at formatting
